# What

This is an investigation into:

-   Literate reproducible programming
-   Multiple languages development
-   The code interview landscape

The tools used are org mode and babel, so examples are in multiple
languages. The main output target is latex for now.

# How

Take some code interview suppliers questions (actual used in
interviews are preferred) and provide a description of the problem,
a design proposal for a solution and implementations of that design
alongside tables of test cases.
